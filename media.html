			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				My full name is Igboayaka Johnpeter Izuchukwu, and I was born in Lagos
				State, Nigeria. Currently, I am a student at Imo State University,
				Owerri, where I am studying Computer Science. My design journey began as
				a graphic designer, which ignited my passion for creativity through
				visual elements. Transitioning from graphic design, I explored the
				creative world of website design to harness and expand my skillset. Over
				the years, I have successfully designed stunning websites for businesses
				and organizations. My creative tools include Photoshop, CorelDRAW, Adobe
				Illustrator, WordPress, and Figma.
				<br />
				<br />
				What sets me apart is my holistic approach to design, combining visual
				creativity with technical expertise. Over the years, I have honed my
				skills in various areas of design and development, including significant
				experience as a WordPress website designer. I have created functional
				and aesthetically pleasing websites for both new and existing
				businesses, ranging from business websites and e-commerce platforms to
				sales pages and beyond. This extensive experience has equipped me with
				the ability to handle diverse project requirements and deliver tailored
				solutions that meet client needs.
